C practical projects for "Practicas de programaci√≥n" subject (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya - Bachelor of Software Engineering)

The exercise consists of passing a battery of tests on class methods which must implement dynamic memory allocation and data structures, such as linked lists or queues.

_Each folder is a CodeLite project. All the code is part the statement of the exercise, except the code preceded by comments such as: "// PRX_EXX", which is written by me_
